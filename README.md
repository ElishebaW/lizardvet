# Project Title

The Veterinarians Portal


### Description

Fantastic Ruby on Rails data analytics app using Highchart.js and Chartkick.js to visualize five metrics using interactive graphs on pets that visit the veterinarian's office.


Users can use the portal to manage vets, clients and pets. They can also see the performance of the practice using the analytics tab of the application. The charts show the average mental, diet, fitness, and social aptitude scores of the pets that visit the practice. The averages can be used to positively impact pet care.


### Challenges or things learned while writing the app

1. Speed of the application (need to work through this)

2. Learned about routing

3. Learned about how to set up data for the HighChart and Chartkick JavaScript libraries

4. Learned about why the CSS grid system is better than the HTML table system
